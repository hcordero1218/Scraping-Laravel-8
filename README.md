# Scraping PHP Laravel 9 + Tailwind CSS

I developed a Web Scraping to Policylead using PHP the framework Laravel 9 + Tailwind.

The Code Challenge consists of scraping Spiegel.de in the section Politic section and getting all the news. I got URL, title, image, text, and date. I got these elements with the library Goutte of Symfony and aplicate the design with Tailwind CSS.
